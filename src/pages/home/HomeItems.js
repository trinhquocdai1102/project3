      "Car insurance is a legal requirement. If you own or drive a car in the UK, the law says you must have at least third-party only insurance. You must have insurance, even if you don't drive your car, and you keep it parked on a road, driveway or in a garage. This applies to all drivers, and you can find car insurance for: young drivers, learner drivers, over 50s, named drivers, new drivers, disabled drivers",

      "Every motorcyclist needs insurance; it's illegal to ride on the roads without it. But there's no good reason to pay over the odds for your motorbike insurance. Letting your policy auto-renew is often the easiest route to over-paying. Loyalty often isn't rewarded when it comes to insurance.",
